* Functionality to allow users to read there own and others recipes
* Functionality to allow users to edit/update recipes they have created
* Functionality to allow users to delete a recipe they have created
* Functionality to allow users to search for recipes
* Functionality to allow users to create an account
* Responsive design and beautiful looking application on all devices

## Structure

* Recipes will be stored in the app on the recipes page for all users to view
* Users will be able to search for recipes via either the name of a recipe or key words from the description of the recipe
* Users will be able to edit or delete recipes they have created via simple and easy to use buttons on the recipes page
